# Danalog Font Assets

The files in this directory are temporary placeholders so the theme can be activated without missing assets.

Replace the following files with the production-ready, self-hosted WOFF2 versions supplied by the Danalog brand team:

- `Manrope-Variable.woff2`
- `SeigneurSerifDisplay-Regular.woff2`

Update `fonts.css` if the final filenames differ. Once replaced, ensure file permissions allow WordPress to serve the fonts and clear any caching layers so the changes propagate to visitors.
